# Optimos V2

The next generation of [Optimos](https://github.com/AutomatedProcessImprovement/roptimus-prime). A Resource, Roster and Batching optimizer using Prosimos simulator.

## Docs

While the code should be documented in most places, you can find additional information on e.g. the architecture in the [docs folder](./docs/)

## Improvements over Legacy Optimos

- **Support to optimize Batching**
- Fully Typed
- Unit Tested (with ~90% coverage)
- Follows a Action-Store-Reducer pattern, similar to Flux
- Multi-Threaded at important parts, takes cpu core count of host machine into account
- Almost all public interfaces are documented
- Class-Based (Not a huge monolithic script)
- No throwaway file creation; Everything in memory
- Immutable Data Structures, so no change to the timetable is ever unexpected
